Description: Separate a data frame in two based on key columns. The function
 unjoin() provides an inside-out version of a nested data frame. This is used
 to identify duplication and normalize it (in the database sense) by linking
 two tables with the redundancy removed. This is a basic requirement for
 detecting topology within spatial structures that has motivated the need for
 this package as a building block for workflows within more applied projects.
