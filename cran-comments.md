# silicate 0.4.0

Apologies for a quick turnaround for this package, less than a month
but required for an upcoming release of a new package. 

Thank you very much. 

## Test environments

* local ubuntu 18.04, R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## CRAN checks

The previous version 0.3.0 has a warning in the vignette build

* r-patched-osx-x86_64

  'dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: ____chkstk_darwin'

## Reverse dependencies

The dependency 'tabularaster' passes check under this version. 

The dependency 'eixport' fails under this version, as with silicate 0.3.0
but the author has been informed and when fixed will work with this version of
silicate.
