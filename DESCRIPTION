Description: Generate common data forms for complex data suitable for conversions and
 transmission by decomposition as 'paths' or 'primitives'. Paths are sequentially-linked records, 
 primitives are basic atomic elements and both can model many forms and be grouped into hierarchical 
 structures.  The universal models 'SC0' (structural) and 'SC' (labelled, relational) are composed of 
 edges and can represent any hierarchical form. Specialist models 'PATH', 'ARC' and 'TRI' provide the 
 most common intermediate forms used for converting from one form to another.
