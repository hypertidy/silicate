Description: Generate a generic common form of complex data, suitable for conversions and
 transmission. Many complex data structures are composed of 'paths' (sequentially-linked records) or 
 'primitives' (basic, component types grouped into higher forms). These two kinds of structure are
 very common, particularly in spatial data, graphics and analytical structures. The universal model 'SC'
 is provided that can represent any of these. Another more specialist model 'PATH' is included as
 as well as tools to switch between these forms, and the component functions for conversions.
